## cli.rs

The `.rs` domain extension is expensive, and can only be purchased on some really shady providers.

I purchased `cli.rs` for anyone in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) community to use.

## How to use

- Add a new file in the `domains` folder with the subdomain you want. Ex: `mycoolproject`
- Inside that file, put the cname you want to alias it to. Ex: `zackify.github.io`
- Create a pull request

The DNS record will be created before I even go to merge the PR :) Enjoy!
