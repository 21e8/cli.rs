## something.cli.rs for Rust projects!

The `.rs` domain extension is expensive, and can only be purchased on some really shady providers.

I purchased `cli.rs` for anyone in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) community to use.

## How to use

- Add a new file in the `domains` folder with the subdomain you want. Ex: `mycoolproject`
- Inside that file, put the cname you want to alias it to. Ex: `zackify.github.io`
- Create a pull request (linking to your project also helps)
- [See this example](https://github.com/zackify/cli.rs/pull/1) if you are confused.

The DNS record will be created when the PR is merged :) Enjoy!

## Long Term

This will (hopefully) have a giant list of cool Rust projects for people to check out in the near future.
